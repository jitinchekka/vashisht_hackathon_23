# BeatBot
This project is an AI-powered music generation system that uses ML and DL to generate music when a tune ( seed notes) are given as input. 
The model uses its input sequence as a starting point and uses its knowledge of music patterns to generate the next notes.
The system is built using Python and uses the following libraries:
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* fluidsynth
* PrettyMIDI
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Flask
## The main code is in the `main.ipynb` file.
